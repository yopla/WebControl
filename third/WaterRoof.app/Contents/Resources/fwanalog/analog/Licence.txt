Analog is copyright (c) Stephen R. E. Turner and other authors 1995 - 2003.
This copyright and licence apply to all source code, compiled code,
documentation, graphics and auxiliary files.

This licence describes the conditions under which you may use, modify and
distribute version 5.32 of analog ("the program"). If you are unable
or unwilling to accept these conditions in full, then, notwithstanding the
conditions in the remainder of this licence, you may not use, modify or
distribute the program at all. Text in square brackets is intended for
guidance only and does not form part of the licence in any way.
[Analog is free software. This licence is designed not to restrict your
freedom except insofar as is necessary to ensure that the program remains free
for all. If you want to do something that is against this licence, but within
the spirit of free software, then let's talk about it.]

Analog includes code from the gd, pcre, png & zlib libraries, and from FreeBSD
and Apache. These portions of code are also subject to their own copyrights
and licensing conditions, which can be found in the analog docs directory in
files with names beginning with "Lic".

1) The program may be used free of charge by any person or organisation to
   whom it is made available, provided that that person accepts the conditions
   of this licence.
   [If you like analog, please consider making a donation towards its
   development at http://www.analog.cx/donations/ . Thank you.]

2) The program may be copied and distributed by any person or organisation in
   any way whatsoever, provided that any distribution is accompanied by a copy
   of all copyright notices and licences pertaining to the program. You may
   charge for distributing the program, but you must not do anything to
   suggest to the person to whom it is distributed that analog itself is
   anything other than free software. Furthermore, you may not charge for
   distributing a modified version of the program unless the source code for
   the modified version, or a list of differences between the modified version
   and the original version, is publicly and freely available in machine
   readable form.
   [If you distribute analog with a book or a magazine or something like that,
   I'd be pleased to receive a copy].

3) You may make a charge for either of the following services, but you must
   not do anything to suggest to your client that analog itself is anything
   other than free software. 
   i) Installing the program on a computer on behalf of a third party;
  ii) Running the program and providing output from it to a third party.
   However, you may not charge for these services in connection with a
   modified version of the program unless the source code for the modified
   version, or a list of differences between the modified version and the
   original version, is publicly and freely available in machine readable
   form.

4) You may modify the program or use part of the source code in another
   program provided that both of the following conditions are met.
   i) Any modification in the source code is clearly marked as such;
  ii) Your program must be licenced at no charge to all third parties under
      the terms of this licence, with no further conditions attached.
   You may claim copyright for the parts of the program you have written.
   Changing the default options in the file anlghead.h and anlghea2.h does not
   count as modifying the program.
   [You are encouraged to submit your changes to me for inclusion in
   subsequent versions of analog. If you wish to use part of the code in a
   program under another licence, then let's talk about it].

5) No warranty of any sort, expressed or implied, is provided in connection
   with the program, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of
   merchantibility or fitness for a particular purpose. Any cost, loss or
   damage of any sort incurred owing to the malfunction or misuse of the
   program or the inaccuracy of the documentation or connected with the program
   in any other way whatsoever is solely the responsibility of the person who
   incurred the cost, loss or damage. Furthermore, any illegal use of the
   program is solely the responsibility of the person committing the illegal
   act. By using this program you accept these responsibilities, and give up
   any right to seek any damages against the authors in connection with this
   program. 
   [You should note that some jurisdictions regulate the collection and
   processing of data relating to individuals.]

6) I, Stephen Turner, reserve the right to make exceptions to any of these
   conditions, or alter these conditions, at any time. However, you may always
   use these conditions instead of any altered version if you prefer.
   [Note that this licence explicitly applies only to one version of
   analog. Therefore, if I make new conditions in connection with a future
   version, you do not then have the right to apply these conditions to that
   version instead].
