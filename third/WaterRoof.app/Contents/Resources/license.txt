NoLicense Public License

Version 1, 31 August 2011 (EN)




PREAMBLE

The fundamental principle of the license NoLicense Public License is the complete freedom of use and circulation of knowledge and therefore the absolute absence of specific obligations or requirements for its access. 

PRINCIPLES

The works of intellect are usually regulated and governed by licenses that require an owner who owns full rights and who may grant a license to use, modify, copy, distribute and sell them. 
The license NoLicense Public License (NLPL) is a non-license because it provides no distinction between the author, the owner and the user of the work. The use or the mere possession of a work, even involuntary or unconscious, determines the full and rightful ownership. As a result there is less chance that it may be claimed sole ownership on the work as it is impossible to attribute its origin and its intellectual property. This license certifies irrevocably the right of everyone to consider and treat the work as their own and dispose of it according to their possibilities and according to their will without any obligation, constraint or limitation. The license NoLicense Public License ensures that the works remain unchanged property of any owner, therefore collective ownerships. The real author of the work renounces in a definitive and irrevocable way to claim exclusive rights of any kind on the work. The actual author also renounces to be formally recognized as such. The spread of anonymous works is allowed and encouraged. The spread of works whose origin is clearly indicated is allowed and protected by the habits. To recognize the artistic, intellectual and technical merits of the actual author, to give practical support for the care, development and maintenance of the work, to encourage its use, dissemination, analysis and criticism are part of these habits. 
As a non-license, the license NoLicense Public License certifies the state of fact and as such does not require that you accept its terms to be valid.
